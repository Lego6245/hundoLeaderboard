# Hundo Leaderboard

This repository contains the github actions and static site hosting the Recipes @ Home project's leaderboard. For more information, see [this video](https://youtu.be/kpn30v5Y_YQ) by TASMalleo, or the main client's repository [here](https://github.com/SevenChords/CipesAtHome).

# Implementation

1. Use a github action to call a python script every hour.
2. That python script fetches the current table's information, formats it, and writes it out to a file. It also archives the previous file into the `historical` folder.
3. `loadData.js` reads the .json file and renders it out to a table. 
4. Github Pages hosts the site.

# TODO

1. Styling for the index page.
2. Load old historical data via query parameter.
3. Maybe some global stats?
4. Typescript support for the client side JS
